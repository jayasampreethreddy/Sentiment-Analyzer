## Sentiment Analysis Model for Movie Reviews

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a sentiment analysis model designed to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments. The model uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze text data and make predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared movie review data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated various models to select the best-performing one.
- **Explainable AI**: Used SHAP and LIME to provide insights into model predictions.
- **Deployment**: Implemented the model in a Flask application for easy access.
- **Cloud Hosting**: Deployed the application on AWS EC2 for scalable, global access.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, feature engineering, and model development.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the model as a web application.
- **AWS EC2**: Cloud service for hosting the application.
- **SHAP and LIME**: Explainable AI tools for interpreting model predictions.
